# Firefly syncronization
![full_length](https://github.com/DvorakDwarf/firefly-automaton/assets/96934612/1a707f5a-c814-4863-9240-0f71ef2695d1)

A cellular automaton simulation of the way fireflies sync their flashes together in the wild. Firefly model inspired by [this Wired article](https://www.wired.com/story/a-new-explanation-for-how-fireflies-flash-in-sync/). I just thought it would look neat and in my humble opinion I was right. It looks kind of life a screensaver, maybe it would work on wallpaper engine. The project is entirely written in Rust.

## Installation
You need Rust installed and I believe that's it
1. `https://github.com/DvorakDwarf/firefly-automaton.git`
2. `cd firefly-automaton`
3. Edit parameters for the simulation in `constants.rs` if you want
4. `cargo run --release`
5. PROFIT

You may do what you want with this, but credit would be much appreciated. Reach out to me on Discord if you have any questions: `histidinedwarf`.
